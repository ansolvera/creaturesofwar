As you read in the title, we are closing in on our first completed, highly polished level. This marks the biggest success we have achieved thus far. Let me walk you through what we have been dealing with and what it took for us to overcome these issues. 

When first developing a tutorial / demo for Alpha testers to playthrough before the release of the game, I had a lot of internal questions to answer. How large should the level be? How many enemy types should we put in? What outstanding features should be displayed in this short playthrough? 

I found myself wanting to deliver on so many different fronts that it took quite a long amount of time to realize what my first important task was. I needed a gripping level that would make people want to keep playing before introducing any of my amazing features. I had to first conceptualize the art assets to be created, actually create the art, and then import them into the project. After importing the artwork, we had to see if everything fit together. This became a big headache for us because of our lack of pixel perfect alignment tools in Unity. In photoshop you can create assets that lineup pixel perfect, everything flows the way it should. After importing into Unity, every sprite (imported art assets from photoshop) has a soft edge, making lining things up perfectly like you did in photoshop an impossibility. So, if you create a building that is 25 times the size of the original building piece given, and every building piece is slightly off, you find yourself with a building that is out of alignment. 

So how does the creation of a large building affect the enemies to be put into the level? How does this affect what feature you will be putting into the level? 

To answer this question, I have to revert back to my original intentions as to why the building was so important to construct in the first place.  This large building is going to be the epicenter of testing the players abilities at the very beginning of the game. The first heavy weapon will be acquired here, the first ambush will take place here, the list goes on and on. Many unique features take place in this large building! After getting the foundational artwork figured out and understanding the layout of the building moving forward, I was able to focus on my art-oriented tasks such as lighting and accenting. The building slowly over the past two months has started to come to life and now looks amazing. Part of the level accenting process is something as trivial as, "Ok we now have a fully rigged Procompsognathus that can go into the level. Should we have a small hole in the wall where these creatures can spawn?" Something a bit more tasteful can be like this, "I want this area to be a combat zone. Let's put a lot of dead researchers in the area and to make it more dramatic and frightening, let's have a few of the lights flicker on and off as well."

I wanted the building to be constructed because I felt it gave me a greater chance to display everything the game currently has to offer, in its best light. Not every feature is going to be a different game mechanic such as a scoped rifle firing and zooming in vs a fully automatic rifle. A feature of a game can be something as simple as a flickering light with a frightening corridor to walk down. I felt that a tight environment was my best bet. 

Now I have not touched upon the fact that there is quite a lot of jungle environment in this level to explore before and after reaching the large building. The scope of this demo / tutorial kept increasing. As the level became prettier and more complex, I have started to have doubts about the length of this level. Is it simply too long? The answer will reveal itself during the Alpha testing of this game. Alpha testing will take place in March. 

Anyways to close out quickly, the bottom line is that the game is headed in the right direction. The first time you take apart and build an engine back together takes forever. You have to learn all of the ins and outs of the engine before you can properly hook things back together. We can confidently say we have achieved this. We took a long time to figure out how to develop environment pathways, building sizes, sloped rooms, etc. Now if we want to rig a new room we can create the art asset, import it, and prefab / place the asset in 1/5 the time. Essentially moving forward, I expect to create levels 300-500% faster than we created this tutorial. Quite frankly that makes me very excited, and I hope it makes you guys excited too.
