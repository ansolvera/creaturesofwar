Wow 2021 Was A Crazy Ride!

Creatures Of War through 2021 changed a lot. We rigged many enemies, produced countless art assets, implemented tons of new combat features, put dynamic lighting into effect, curated hundreds of custom sfx's, produced many new songs and rigged everything together with passionate nerd glue. Looking back on this year I am proud of my team and all of the hard work we put forth to make this game a possibility. We are starting now to see the pieces fall into place. The artwork is starting to add up, the levels are looking quite beautiful. The combat system is on the brink of working smoothly. The SFX's library is vast and brings out the personality of the island while the music produces sweet notes of fear and panic while exploring this crazy world. 

Looking forward to 2022 we can expect a lot of huge milestones. The combat system is expected to be fully rigged and will be tested vigorously to make sure the AI is up to snuff. The Demo is expected to be fully operational by March, everyone will get to play the game in a short vertical slice! On top of this the game's art will be getting a surge in productivity as we bring on an additional artist to help with the workload. Oh, and did I forget to mention that I will be significantly reducing my hours at my other business to enable me to pump even more hours into this game?! I am already working full time on Creatures Of War, but I think it is time to power up to sixty hours a week or more. This extra time will be used to make sure that everything comes together smoothly. Also, in 2022 it is time to complete a trailer and to start spreading the word about Creatures Of War. A soft announcement was made in 2021 in October when the game was announced. In 2022 I am looking to create lots of hype around Creatures Of War so people are on the lookout for this game when we plan to release in 2023.

Well That All Sounds Good But Isn't That A lot Of Work? 

I have been planning for years now that 2022 was going to be the year of putting my head down and knocking this project out of the park. I am going to be posting more regularly come March across my social media platforms. I have thought about potential burnout as an issue but there is one thing going for me here. I am working on a video game, my video game. As combat comes together and things start moving along, I am no longer working on back-end systems that can take a week or a month to materialize. I get to focus on playtesting, balance changes, visual effects, you know the fun stuff?! 

What Is Your Favorite Part Of Creatures Of War?

My favorite part of Creatures Of War is the fast paced, brutal combat. The Dilophosaurus is the primary dinosaur we are testing everything on before transporting his AI to all of the other creatures of similar structure and design. He moves fast, hits hard, and is intelligent. The Dilophosaurus is the equivalent to a mini boss in many other games. Guess what? He is a moderately difficult creature in Creatures Of War. The difficulty ceiling in this game is based on mastery of the given combat variables. Grenade usage, dodge and sprint timings, weapon accuracy, exploration / treasure recovery and upgrade effectiveness. A comprehensive combat system that integrates all of these components is going to deliver an immersive experience that makes people beg for a sequel. That is what I am hear to do. I aim to blow everyone away with a game that is difficult but fair, complicated yet simple, beautiful and immersive. You will have to wait until March before you can see for yourself. 

Bring It On 2022 I am ready. 

Cheers, 

Tim @ Chaos Entertainment
