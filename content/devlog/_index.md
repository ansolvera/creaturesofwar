Creatures Of War was announced across my social media channels through both a steam page and the website you are currently on now. The question that everyone is probably thinking is, “Where the hell is the trailer?”. Well to have a robust and captivating trailer that most people will approve of, I need to accomplish a few of these listed points in no particular order. 

* Art work is needed across a few select biomes.
* Combat was working nicely but then sadly had to be broken to implement many new features, getting combat wired back in is a must. 
* Creating all the necessary SFX’s for the desired units in the trailer is needed, most are complete but a few stragglers remain. 
* Polishing the VFX’s from grenade explosions to blood splatters needs some attention, not a lot but it’s current state is not acceptable. 

A More Detailed Breakdown

The past three to four months has been a wild ride for my artist. She has been pulled in a million directions at once. One minute she is working on the flooring of a building in the compound, the next she is creating the cover image for the game, after that she goes back to the compound flooring… psyche, nope now she is creating all of the art assets for the website. Basically she has spent hundreds of hours creating assets for anything but the game itself. Now that she has knocked out 98% of the promotional materials she can focus on what is important, the game. 

Combat in Creatures Of War is on the mend. The player is currently a bit janky due to animation transitions breaking which occurred as a result of implementing many new animation states allowing for proper level traversal. The idea to initially flesh out combat before level traversal was this, if the combat sucks, why work on anything else? So that is what we did, we created a combat system that is energetic and alive, flows naturally, and is gritty as all hell. Now that our attention is back on getting the trailer ready, combat should be operational shortly, I cannot wait to show you the result of all this hard work. 

The SFX’s are actually quite close to being completed. I knew a while out that we needed certain sounds to be created for certain creatures, weapons, and of course the player. The creatures in the trailer are almost entirely finished with their SFX’s, the weapons have been polished off for a while now, and the player needs a proper voice actor to give us the necessary sounds for his star role in this game. 

The VFX’s are all completed, they just lack that level of polish that a publicly released game requires. These visual effects include the grenade explosions, muzzle flashes, etc. They are all very close though, not a lot of work (Or so I think, I always say this and bite my tongue).

How long Did You Say?

The time table for the trailer to be completed is approximately sixteen weeks to twenty weeks. I not only want combat to work but I need it to be very responsive, thus playtesting is going to be extensive to ensure the game is ready to be shown in it’s best light. The art will not take long as a lot of the art assets already exist. Building out a few new assets and layering them to showcase a larger area will not take long. The SFX’s need another month or so before we have the required lot for the trailer. The VFX’s will likely take less than a week to fully polish. Not much of a concern there. 

But wait there's more!

I need to hire a professional to create the Creatures Of War trailer. The amount of time it takes to create a trailer can take anywhere from a few weeks to a month. This includes breaking down key gameplay areas, displaying NPC interactions, all of the editing, storyboarding, recaptures, etc. Understanding the time it takes to create a trailer is why I think this will take twenty weeks to complete, the game could be ready to go but the Game Trailer Editor may need up to a full month's time to get the trailer just right. Remember I only get one shot to make a really solid impression on everybody.  

Quite a lengthy post but I wanted to be transparent about the game development process with everyone from the beginning. Topics for the future will include an in-depth breakdown on the art development process, how SFX’s are created, how we capture the essence of the game through Creatures Of War’s musical score, and of course anything else that I think is awesome!

Cheers for now,

Tim from Chaos Entertainment
