Over the past few months, the emphasis on getting a working vertical slice has been pushed extremely hard. The workload ranges from getting doors operating, audio events firing, smoothing out combat, adjusting weapon scopes, adding in level art, adjusting art layers, etc. The list is very long and is outside the scope of this post. What is important is the progress that has been made. 

In the next few weeks, we will be tying up a lot of loose ends. These are low hanging fruits, many of which were listed in the previous paragraph. While each individual loose end does not take a long time to accomplish, when you add them all up together, the task becomes exponentially more time consuming. What I am most excited about is the fact that we are getting the level traversing systems implemented into the game. The player is now able to operate elevators and climb up and down ropes. The last remaining step is enabling the player to climb up and down ladders. These are all basic features that many games share, anything spicier? 

We are excited to announce that night vision has been fully rigged and implemented. The player is going to be venturing into dark rooms and the night vision goggles will help traverse these dark corridors without too much worry. They work by targeting all of the pixels on the screen. These pixels are then modified to have enhanced green values and light values based upon previous recorded value settings. This is great because the player will be staring at an extremely bright screen when wearing the night vision goggles in a lit room. Thus, making them strictly work in dark spaces, just like in real life. Awesome!

Slowly the ambience of Creatures of War is coming together. A gel of horror, action, and exploration. The addition of lighting effects, custom sfx's, and a harrowing soundtrack breathe life into this thrilling world we are so excited to share. 

While the artwork for the Alpha level / Demo is 99% complete, here is a quick look into half completed sprite for the far background of the cave level. Enjoy!
